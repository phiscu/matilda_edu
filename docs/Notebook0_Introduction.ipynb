    "Welcome to **MATILDA-Online**, the Python-based workflow for **Modeling Water Resources in Glacierized Catchments**! This book describes the comprehensive toolkit in detail and guides you step-by-step from data acquisition to analysis of climate change impacts on the selected catchment. Designed with flexibility and accessibility in mind, MATILDA integrates robust scientific models, public data sources, and user-friendly tools to make sophisticated glacio-hydrological modeling accessible to researchers, practitioners, and students alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow is divided into a series of interactive notebooks, each focused on a specific component of the modeling process. These notebooks streamline complex tasks such as catchment delineation, data processing, model calibration, and climate scenario analysis, ensuring clarity and reproducibility at each step:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Notebook 1 - Catchment Delineation](Notebook1_Catchment_delineation.ipynb):** Delineate your catchment and retrieve static geospatial data, including digital elevation models, glacier outlines, and ice thickness distributions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **[Notebook 2 - Forcing Data](Notebook2_Forcing_data.ipynb):** Acquire and process ERA5-Land reanalysis data, preparing inputs for glacio-hydrological model calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Notebook 3 - CMIP6 Climate Data](Notebook3_CMIP6.ipynb):** Download and process historical and future climate data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) for two emission scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Notebook 4 - MATILDA Model](Notebook4_MATILDA.ipynb):** Run the MATILDA model with default parameters and calibrate it based on mutiple objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Notebook 5 - Scenario Simulations](Notebook5_MATILDA_scenarios.ipynb):** Apply your calibrated parameter set to run the model over all CMIP6 ensemble members for robust scenario-based analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Notebook 6 - Result Analysis & Impact Assessment](Notebook6_Analysis.ipynb):** Visualize model output in interactive plots across ensemble simulations, extract key meteorological and hydrological indicators of of climate change impacts, and create a visual summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow below is demonstrated using a sample site in the Tian Shan Mountains of Kyrgyzstan. To try the toolkit for yourself, simply click on the rocket icon in the toolbar above to launch an online environment hosted by [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/). There you can run any notebook with the sample data or upload your own and edit the config file accordingly. Note that while most of the workflow will work fine in the binder, calibrating the model is computationally intensive and will be slow to run on a single CPU. For a comprehensive calibration that takes full advantage of the [spotpy](https://spotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library, we recommend downloading the notebooks and running them on a local machine with multi-core processing capabilities. Additional options to reduce calibration time are described in Notebook 4.\n",
